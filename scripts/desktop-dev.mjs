// ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// desktop-dev.mjs — launch `tauri dev` with a self-healing PATH.
//
// Why this exists: `tauri dev` shells out to `cargo`. On Windows especially, a
// terminal opened *before* rustup was installed keeps a stale PATH snapshot
// that lacks `~/.cargo/bin`, so `bun desktop` dies with
//     failed to run 'cargo metadata' command … program not found
// even though cargo IS installed and IS on the persisted User PATH — a brand
// new terminal would find it. Rather than make every contributor remember to
// reopen their shell, prepend the standard rustup bin dir here when cargo isn't
// already resolvable. Cross-platform (`~/.cargo/bin` on macOS/Linux/Windows)
// and a complete no-op when cargo is already on PATH, so nothing changes for
// anyone whose environment is already correct.
//
// Invoked as the frontend `desktop` script (`bun ../scripts/desktop-dev.mjs`),
// so cwd is frontend/ and `bun run tauri dev` resolves the workspace-local
// @tauri-apps/cli. All extra args are forwarded untouched.

 * stack *including its Vite server* — leaving its window open, pointed at a
 * dev URL that no longer answers, with an empty #root. The user sees a black
 * app and nothing explains why.
